Keypirinha Plugin: Cvt
=========
# A universal unit converter for the Keypirinha launcher

This plugin for Keypirinha provides unit conversions for the following measures:

* Distance
* Area
* Volume
* Mass
* Speed
* Time
* Force
* Pressure
* Energy
* Power
* Fuel Consumption
* Temperature
* Data Size

Usage:

"Cvt" <measure> <tab> <number> <space> <from-unit-optional> <to-unit-optional>

It sound complex but it is actually very easy and Cvt prompts you all the way. For example, to convert 12 inches to meters you type in the lauchbox:

Cvt <space> d <tab> 12 in mt <enter>

New conversions (including new measures) can be added in the cvtdefs.json file.

Installation:

Download the cvt.keypirinha-package pacakge file to the Keypirinha\portable\Profile\InstalledPackages folder
