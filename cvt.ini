[main]
# Plugin's main configuration section.

#Can Cvt load a user provided measurement definition file?
# * Cvt uses a built-in measurement definition file called cvtdefs.json
# * You can place a customized version of this file in the User folder
# * If you add such file, a Reload command is added for convenience
# * It is useful for extending and experimenting with Cvt
# * If you have generally useful measurements to add - let me know on Cvt's github

# The display name of the default item
# Default: "Cvt: "
#item_label = "Cvt: "

[var]
# As in every Keypirinha's configuration file, you may optionally include a
# [var] section to declare variables that you want to reuse anywhere else in
# this file.
#
# Note that the [var] section is inherited, which means that any value defined
# in the main configuration file (i.e. this file) will be propagated to
# subsequently loaded configuration files (packages' configuration files).
